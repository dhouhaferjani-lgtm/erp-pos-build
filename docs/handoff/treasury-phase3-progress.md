## Tasks

Progress, files touched, test evidence, deviations, and gate verdicts are appended here after each task.

## Deviations

None yet. Task A4 must record the sanctioned Amendment A-1 sequential race-shape substitution.

## Contradictions

None found during pre-flight review.

### Task A1 — Status-scoped treasury-transfer JE uniqueness

- Status: complete
- Files:
  - `apps/api/database/migrations/tenant/2026_07_12_100000_unique_journal_entries_source_treasury_transfer.php`
  - `docs/handoff/treasury-phase3-progress.md`
- Verification:
  - `php -l apps/api/database/migrations/tenant/2026_07_12_100000_unique_journal_entries_source_treasury_transfer.php` — no syntax errors.
  - Testing-env SQLite `php artisan migrate ... --pretend --force` — exit 0; emitted the partial unique-index SQL with `status = 'posted'`.
  - Full testing-env SQLite `php artisan migrate --force` on an isolated temporary database — exit 0; A1 migration applied in 0.44 ms.
  - SQLite schema inspection — exact unique index present on `(source_type, source_id)` with `WHERE source_type = 'treasury_transfer' AND status = 'posted'`.
- TDD: binding plan explicitly defers behavioral replay/index coverage to Task A5; A1 is migration-only and was verified by syntax, pretend SQL, real migration, and schema inspection.
- Deviations: the plan's literal pretend command was first cancelled by Laravel's production-environment safety prompt (exit 1). It was rerun non-interactively with the PHPUnit SQLite/testing environment and `--force` (exit 0). No implementation deviation.
